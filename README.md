# delet<sup>3</sup> suggestions

[delet 2.8.3](https://github.com/DS-Development/delet) will be deprecated and replaced by delet<sup>3</sup> (v3.0.0), which exists in a new repository. Therefore, as the old version of delet is no longer maintained, its repository has been archived. 

This also means that issues can no longer be created (for the purpose of suggestions/feature requests for delet<sup>3</sup>).

This repository will (temporarily) serve as a place for feature requests to exist.

**To submit a new feature request:**
- open a new issue
- give the issue a descriptive title
- describe your feature request with a sufficient level of detail

<sub>Note that this repository is **not** for bug reports for delet 2.x.x, as it is no longer maintained/supported.</sub>
